<p className="para">Sagastrand Restaurant beside the swimming pool is a new, very nice and unique building, a landmark when seen from the sea. On the ground floor is the restaurant, the bar and the stage. In the spacious 1st floor you can also enjoy your meal, while looking out on the beatiful view which also gives you a front seat to the sunset. You can also play billiard or have a romantic evening while having a beer, a drink or a glass of wine. The beach hut with space for 6-8 persons is very popular for our lunch guests, where they enjoy their lunch at the beach in quiet and nice surroundings.</p>
